# CITS3001 FINAL EXAM BREAKDOWN
***DON'T PANIC***

## Exam Info
- 50% of the total mark.
- Covers all materials discuss, unless marked as non-assessable.
- 120 mins (2hrs)
- Same exam run online and face-to-face
- [Instructions for online LMS exams](AI/LMSOnlineExamInstructions.pdf)
- 1 page of double-sided A4 of notes and calculators permitted.
- [Past Papers where you can comment and share your answers](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J6Hsa4JnHTJ2zyrXxqU9CMQ3JUZYhjWa?usp=sharing)
- Past papers demonstrate *style* of questions. **BUT** since we have notes, the questions will be less recall and more open-ended.
- Topics cover lecture material in 2016/2017 (not sure if this is absolutely true or a bait).
- ***Previous exams reviewed in workshop of Week 12*** (attempt first)

## Exam Problems Breakdown
Knowing what kind of questions will be asked and how to answer them is half the battle.

Types of questions (mainly based on 2018/19 exams):
- ~~String Algorithms~~
	- Cut content in CITS3001 2021
- ~~Definitions~~
	- Definition questions such as Q1 2019 will not be in the 2021 exam as double-sided A4 notes are allowed.
		- So I think the format will be closer to 2018/19 exams minus the Definition section, and **not** like 2016/17 because of how many *define* and *describe* type questions they have.
	- ***or maybe they will???***
- [[Algorithms]]
	- I'm not sure if this will even be included but...
	- Be familiar with [[Dynamic Programming]]
- [[Optimization]]
	- Be familiar with [[P vs NP|P, NP and NP-Hard]]
	- Be familiar with the kinds of [[Optimization Problems]]
	- [[Travelling Salesman Problem]] types, and appropriate solutions using [[Optimization]]
	- How [[Optimization]] algorithms escape [[Local Optima]]
- [[Search]]
	- Give pseudocode for algorithms
		- Explain data-structures required for optimal implementation
	- Solve simple games using [[Search Algorithms]]
	- Know how to create and judge heuristics for [[A* Search]]
- [[Game-playing]]
	-  Describe simple games as an [[Sequential Decision Problem]]
		-  How states are represented
		-  What actions and states are possible
		-  Assigning cost to moves and states
		-  Explain a certain equation (e.g. [[Bellman Equation]]) within the context of the game, and how to use it to generate an optimal strategy.
		-  Compare/contrast effectiveness with a different strategy, generated by a different algorithm.
			-  Optimal and Complete
			-  Time and space complexity
			-  Search/state-space of the game
- **SIDENOTE**: knowledge/familiarity with the project game is expected in the [[Learning Agents]] and [[Reasoning and Planning]] section of the exam. Shouldn't be too difficult, but just make sure you won't get caught off-guard by how they present the data.
-  [[Learning Agents]]
	-  Generate a [[Decision Tree]] consistent with data given
		-  Explain how and why you order the selected features a particular way
	-  Describe how different types of [[Learning]] can be used to learn strategies for simple games
	- Weigh the pros and cons of different approaches to [[Learning]]
-  [[Reasoning and Planning]]
	-  Explain [[First-Order Logic]] formulas in English
	-  Apply [[Resolution]] on a given [[Knowledge-Base]]
	-  Given a [[Planning System]] describe steps of a [[Partial Order Planner]] to construct a plan to achieve some goal
